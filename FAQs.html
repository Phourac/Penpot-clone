                    You probably arrived here because you either wanted to understand the Why Penpot or the How Penpot
                    questions. Both are fine and we have grouped those questions attending to that soft categorisation.
                    This FAQ will continue to evolve and, at some point, will probably require more ergonomics, filters
                    and search. For now, let’s see how it goes.

                <p class="text-2xl break-words leading-tight pt-10 pb-10 max-w-2xl">
                    These are questions related to the fact that Penpot even exists or what is particularly different
                    and new about it.
                </p>
                <h3 class="mt-0 pt-16 text-4xl font-semibold pb-10">Who created Penpot? Why?</h3>
                <p class="text-lg break-words leading-tight pb-7 max-w-2xl">
                    There is a company called <a href="#" class="underline text-green-500">Kaleidos Open Source</a> that
                    has been long known for its commitment to free & open source software and a more diverse and
                    inclusive workplace where cross-domain teams really enjoy working together. Kaleidos launched <a
                        href="" class="underline text-green-500">Taiga</a> a few years ago to deal with the absence of a
                    truly agile open source project management tool. The next major pain in our ranked list of
                    outrageous open source absentees was a design & prototype tool like Figma, Sketch or Invision.</p>
                <p class="text-lg break-words pb-7 leading-tight max-w-2xl">
                    At Kaleidos we believe that the tools that we use to build end products should be as accessible to
                    everyone, regardless of their background, skills or purchasing power. Also, not having a free &amp;
                    open source UX/UI tool that would make devs participate in the design process and bridge the gap
                    between UX/UI and code was a terrible itch for us.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg break-words pb-7 leading-tight max-w-2xl">
                    We created Penpot out of the need to enjoy design freedom for cross-domain teams.
                </p>
                <h3 class="mt-0 pt-16 text-4xl font-semibold pb-10">
                    Why specifically Open Source?
                </h3>
                <p class="text-lg break-words pb-7 leading-tight max-w-2xl">
                    It`s our very personal choice to make sure that we create tools that inject more freedom into the
                    system. Open Source means pursuing a fairer society, where opportunities are more evenly
                    distributed. Software Technology has the unique advantage, compared to other industries and
                    intellectual property, of having almost zero cost to replicate itself, thus providing a wonderful
                    chance to massively distribute the tools for a more digitally sovereign society.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg break-words pb-7 leading-tight max-w-2xl">
                    Besides the pure license aspect of it and its legal framework, Open Source fosters more engaging
                    communities where the lines between user and contributor are often blurred.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg break-words pb-7 leading-tight max-w-2xl">
                    In particular, we chose the very respected Mozilla Public License 2.0 because it made software
                    delivered through the web or a service subject to the same rules as software that runs natively on
                    your operating system.
                </p>
                <h3 class="mt-0 pt-16 text-4xl font-semibold pb-10">
                    Why is SVG its native format?
                </h3>
                <p class="text-lg break-words pb-7 leading-tight max-w-2xl">
                    SVG (Scalar Vector Graphics) is a widely used Open Standard by the <a
                        href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/" target="_blank">W3C</a>. It permeates the web, the mobile
                    world and visualisation outputs across a myriad of platforms.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg break-words pb-7 leading-tight max-w-2xl">
                    Embracing SVG was a technical challenge but it was a huge opportunity too. It makes a Penpot design
                    itself valid code already. Moreover, the potential for integrations and interoperability are
                    infinite.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg break-words pb-7 leading-tight max-w-2xl">
                    When you are certain that a part of your design is SVG and you live-export that SVG as part of your
                    code repository, you can have back and forth changes through the SVG files. Also, a “continuous
                    design” process could be finally at hand.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg break-words pb-7 leading-tight max-w-2xl">
                    Using SVG means that there is no translation between a design and its “mathematical” representation.
                    The design is the SVG and the SVG is the design. This is a triumph for cross-domain collaboration.
                </p>
                <h3 class="mt-0 pt-16 text-4xl font-semibold pb-10">
                    Why is Penpot different from [X proprietary product]?
                </h3>
                <p class="text-lg break-words pb-7 leading-tight max-w-2xl">
                    It would be tempting to go on a feature-comparison mode here. That`s not going to happen. In terms
                    of functionality Penpot is just fine already and with every new month, we will be bridging the gap
                    between other well-known tools (founded between 2010 and 2012) and our hectic release cycle.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg break-words pb-7 leading-tight max-w-2xl">
                    What is really different is the combination of four key elements:
                </p>
                <ol class="list-decimal ml-5">
                    <li class="text-lg break-words pb-5 leading-tight max-w-2xl"><strong>Open Source</strong>. This is a
                        game-changer for the design and prototype world. It means you can trust your designs are your
                        own. You can adapt or improve the code or benefit from others doing so. You can host your own
                        Penpot instance (also, native app in the works). You can integrate it the way you want. There’s
                        no limit with technology sovereignty. </li>
                    <li class="text-lg break-words pb-5 leading-tight max-w-2xl"><strong>SVG</strong>. The fact that we
                        don`t go for yet another proprietary format is a blow of fresh air. SVG is what code needs and
                        wants, making the cooperation between design and code suddenly much easier. </li>
                    <li class="text-lg break-words pb-5 leading-tight max-w-2xl"><strong>Cross-domain team
                            focus</strong>. Teams that are able to integrate many different skills and backgrounds and
                        still enjoy a fruitful conversation (and project) are amazing to watch. Penpot aims to deliver
                        the perfect tool for visual designers that is wholeheartedly embraced by developers too.</li>
                    <li class="text-lg break-words pb-5 leading-tight max-w-2xl"><strong>No platform
                            dependencies</strong>. Penpot requires a browser, that`s it. If you want to host your own
                        Penpot instance, that`s fine too. We plan to release a native app bundle later this year.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="text-lg break-words pt-5 pb-7 leading-tight max-w-2xl">
                    There is a theme here. Universal access. That`s why we love to call our product Penpot, there`s
                    nothing more personal and yet more universal than a pot full of pens. It`s all about choice.
                </p>
                <h3 class="mt-0 pt-16 text-4xl font-semibold pb-10">
                    Why did you develop Penpot using Clojure and Clojurescript?
                </h3>
                <p class="text-lg break-words pb-7 leading-tight max-w-2xl">
                    Penpot is a very specific type of tool that demands high performance on the web. Penpot also has the
                    challenging task of seamlessly manipulating zillions of mathematical objects with no information
                    loss. Functional programming languages like Clojure excel at this.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg break-words pb-7 leading-tight max-w-2xl">
                    It is one of those instances where you absolutely need a specific technology to be able to achieve a
                    robust tool like Penpot in a short period of time.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg break-words pb-7 leading-tight max-w-2xl">
                    Since Clojure is not (yet?) a mainstream programming language, we are making sure that there will be
                    ways to extend Penpot using other more common languages such as Javascript. Also, at the backend
                    level, appropriate APIs will be in place to easily connect Penpot with other platforms.
                </p>
                <h3 class="mt-0 pt-16 text-4xl font-semibold pb-10">
                    Why did you release Penpot as an Alpha?
                </h3>
                <p class="text-lg break-words pb-7 leading-tight max-w-2xl">
                    We couldn`t wait any longer. Back in February 2020 we promised that it would take as a year to
                    develop a sort of 1.0. The “alpha” tag might be misleading, it`s quite stable and feature-rich but
                    in some ways it`s still immature with regards to our vision.
                </p>
                <h3 class="mt-0 pt-16 text-4xl font-semibold pb-10">
                    Why did Penpot move to Beta?
                </h3>
                <p class="text-lg break-words pb-7 leading-tight max-w-2xl">
                    Penpot is labeled as beta from the beginning of November 2021. Since its public launch in February
                    2021, Penpot capabilities and benefits have grown at an astonishing fast rate. Meanwhile, we
                    constantly came back to one recurring question: Is Penpot really an alpha product anymore?
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg break-words pb-7 leading-tight max-w-2xl">
                    The combination of core features, maturity, stability and how comfortable teams seem to be while
                    using it made the trick. Also, we saw amazing validation from the community as a whole (take a look
                    at our github). Learn more about the details behind the change <a href="#" target="_blank"

                    behind Penpot, has the resources and the team needed to do that. If Penpot really succeeds and
                    demands more and more resources, a bigger team and a bigger infrastructure, we will need to find
                    ways to monetize some aspects of Penpot. Many Open Source platforms have been very successful at
                    that, without reverting to closing up the source code.

                    SaaS subscriptions offer a quite valid and straightforward business model on top of Open Source. We

                    supported Penpot deployments à-la-Gitlab. No bullshit Open Core models based on some iteration of a
                    “Tax the rich” sound reasonable but we’re still unsure about what would make sense. At the moment,
                    though, this is something we don’t plan to address until 2023.

                    No, we're not. Kaleidos Ventures SL is just a private rebranding of Kaleidos Open Source SL. It's
                    the same bunch of people that 10 years ago created a company to build digital products for other
                    startups. Many of us had been free &amp; open source enthusiasts and hackers for over 10 years (mid
                    90's) already back then, so we wanted to make sure we stood behind our values around technology and
                    society. Thanks to our internal innovation and incubation process (<a href="https://piweek.com"
                        target="_blank">ΠWEEK</a>), <a href="https://taiga.io" target="_blank">Taiga</a> was born a few
                    years ago. In recent times, we also needed something like Penpot, so we created an internal
                    prototype, after which we asked ourselves whether it would be challenging but also cool to ditch all
                    third-party consultancy contracts and just focus on OUR free &amp; open source products. We said
                    "Yes! Let's do this!". To name this risky and exciting business shift during pandemic times, it was
                    convenient to create a child company, Kaleidos Ventures SL, and we asked for a bit of seed money to
                    make sure we could build a solid professional tool, but the transition has been flawless and our <a

                    Current private Penpot instances are only requiring basic Docker knowledge. You can run your own

                    At the moment that would require that you install Penpot locally and so you connect to localhost.
                    Instructions for this using Docker can be found here: <a

                    The easiest way to do that in Penpot is to create a team and add projects as you need them. All
                    those projects and files will be available for your team and you will be able to work either
                    asynchronously or simultaneously.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg break-words pb-5 leading-tight max-w-2xl">

                    A Penpot user can be part of many different teams and have access to all their available projects.

                <p class="text-lg break-words pb-5 leading-tight max-w-2xl">

                    If you want to have a shareable URL to show your designs you can do it from the VIEW mode: launch it
                    using the PLAY button at the top right of the file, and you'll find a SHARE URL button to create the
                    link at the top right. Copy and send that link for other people to access the design.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg break-words pb-5 leading-tight max-w-2xl">

                    You can always invalidate a shared URL if you don`t wish to continue to make it accessible through

                    sets and other graphic assets, before importing them into Penpot to create more complete and
                    visually attractive interface designs. There are other tools that can complete your workflow, such

                    Did the team find a pattern (design, interaction, tool) that could be improved but decided to keep
                    it because the reference tools already made it familiar to the user?
                </h3>
                <p class="text-lg break-words pb-5 leading-tight max-w-2xl">
                     Short answer would be no, we do not keep things from improving because of the potential loss of
                    familiarity.

                    It is true that we are using known patterns to ease the learning curve, this is part of Penpot’s
                    strategy. Given that, we could say that “familiar” is included in our definition of success, but
                    this might be for a different, also interesting, conversation. We do not hide that we have kept an
                    eye not only on Figma but also on many other “usual suspects” (Sketch, Adobe XD, Inkscape, Webflow,
                    Blender...) to study common patterns. However, our design decisions are based not only on previous
                    research but also on testing solutions with users. Therefore, if we were to find that something
                    works better for us in a different way, we`d go for it. Masks and toolbars are some examples of this
                    approach.
